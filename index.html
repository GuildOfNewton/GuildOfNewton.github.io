	      <h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
	        <p>Welcome to the RPG Guild of Newton!  We are a role-player
             group with an emphasis on Dungeons and Dragons.  We
             appreciate you being a part of the group and hope you
             have fun.  We also appreciate your patients as we get
             things going.  We hope to start meeting weekly in
             February 2023.  We'll remind you as we get closer.
             Discord will be where all official communications
             will be, so check there often.</p>

         <h2 id="what_to_bring">What to Bring</h2>
         <p>
            Generally speaking one doesn't need a lot of materials to
            play Dungeons and Dragons.  If you're thinking about
            coming for the first time and have never played
            just bring yourself the first time.
         </p>
         <h3>The Digital Way</h3>
         <p>
            A smartphone, tablet, chormebook or laptop could take the
            place of anything one might need for Dungeons and Dragons.
            The D&amp;D Beyond App can help you create and use your
            character sheet and roll dice for you.  There are a
            number of other apps that help you play D&amp;D as well.
            Make sure you bring a charger with your device since
            sessions can last four hours or longer.
         </p><p>
            While most everything can be done on a device, battles
            take place on a mat on the table. It is helpful
            to have a miniature of your character. 
         </p>
         <h3>The Paper Way</h3>
         <p>
            Below is a list of basic items.  One wouldn't need
            all of these necessarily, but they may be helpful.
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>Polyhedral Dice Set</td>
              <td>Dice the most important thing to have.  Sets
                  come with a 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 2 12-, and a 20-sided die.
              </td>
            </tr><tr>
              <td><a href="">
                Character Sheet</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                While you could make your character in D&amp;D Beyond and
                print out your character sheet, we don't object to the old
                school method here.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Miniature of your Character</td>
              <td>Most of D&amp;D takes place in our imagination.
                  However, battles typically play out on a tabletop
                  mat and having a minature helps keep track of where
                  your character is at.  There are cheap ones
                  to be acquired or you could make one yourself.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>A notebook or journal</td>
              <td>While it isn't necessary it is beneficial
                  to take notes on what has happened for future
                  reference.
            </tr>

              <td>While one can learn to play just by being a part
                  of the group, it is helpful to have the
                  player's handbook to read and reference</td>

          <p><b>The RPG Guild of Newton</b> is dedicated to providing a fun,
             safe, and harassment-free experience for everyone,
            regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
            disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
            We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, in or out of game.
            Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave.</p>
	
          <p><b>Harassment</b> includes offensive comments about gender,
             gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, appearance,
             body size, race, religion, sexual images, intimidation,
             stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
             sustained disruption of the game, inappropriate physical
             contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked
             to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
          
          <p>The Dungeon Masters, or DM for short, are the ones
             in charge of their table.  They are there to facilitate gameplay,
             direct NPC’s and make the final decision on rules.  While
             Dungeons & Dragons publish rules to the games there is room
             for interpretation and for each DM to decide on what rules to
             use or not. It is ultimately up to the DM on what rules they
             play with.  The DM’s have the final say on any rules dispute.
             Please, respect what the DM says and avoid game-stopping arguments
             about rules.  DM’s are expected to keep the gameplay fun and
             engaging for all players.</p>
          
          <p><b>The financial requirements</b> to play are really up to you the
             player.  D&D can be a very cheap game to play either using an
             existing mobile device like a smartphone/tablet or just using
             paper and pencil.  On the other hand, D&D can get expensive
             with gemstone dice, custom-manufactured miniatures, and
             hand-carved dice towers.  We do not want players not
             participating due to cost.  If you cannot afford something,
             please, speak with one of the organizers or email
             info@guildofnewton.org.  We can attempt to help you.
             The organizers try to keep the costs as low as possible.</p>
          
          <p><b>Play safe and clean.</b>  No weapons, real or props, are allowed
             on the premises. The only weapons allowed are in-game,
             imaginary weapons, or as part of a miniature of the character.
             This group is open to all ages.  Please, use appropriate
             language and imagery for the youngest member at your table.
             Please, include all players while playing.  Be respectful to
             each other and the DMs.  The venue is allowing us to play
             here for very cheap.  Please, make sure you leave it in as
             good or better condition as you found it.</p>
