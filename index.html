	      <h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
	        <p>Welcome to the RPG Guild of Newton!  We are a role-player
             group with an emphasis on Dungeons and Dragons.  We
             appreciate you being a part of the group and hope you
             have fun.  We also appreciate your patients as we get
             things going.  We hope to start meeting weekly in
             February 2023.  We'll remind you as we get closer.
             Discord will be where all official communications
             will be, so check there often.</p>

         <h2 id="what_to_bring">What to Bring</h2>
         <p>
            Generally speaking one doesn't need a lot of materials to
            play Dungeons and Dragons.  If you're thinking about
            coming for the first time and have never played
            just bring yourself the first time.
         </p>
         <h3>The Digital Way</h3>
         <p>
            A smartphone, tablet, chormebook or laptop could take the
            place of anything one might need for Dungeons and Dragons.
            The D&amp;D Beyond App can help you create and use your
            character sheet and roll dice for you.  There are a
            number of other apps that help you play D&amp;D as well.
            Make sure you bring a charger with your device since
            sessions can last four hours or longer.
         </p><p>
            While most everything can be done on a device, battles
            take place on a mat on the table. It is helpful
            to have a miniature of your character. 
         </p>
         <h3>The Paper Way</h3>
         <p>
            Below is a list of basic items.  One wouldn't need
            all of these necessarily, but they may be helpful.
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>Polyhedral Dice Set</td>
              <td>Dice the most important thing to have.  Sets
                  come with a 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 2 12-, and a 20-sided die.
              </td>
            </tr><tr>
              <td><a href="">
                Character Sheet</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                While you could make your character in D&amp;D Beyond and
                print out your character sheet, we don't object to the old
                school method here.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Miniature of your Character</td>
              <td>Most of D&amp;D takes place in our imagination.
                  However, battles typically play out on a tabletop
                  mat and having a minature helps keep track of where
                  your character is at.  There are cheap ones
                  to be acquired or you could make one yourself.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>A notebook or journal</td>
              <td>While it isn't necessary it is beneficial
                  to take notes on what has happened for future
                  reference.
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606/ref=sr_1_1">D&amp;D Player Handbook</a></td>
              <td>While one can learn to play just by being a part
                  of the group, it is helpful to have the
                  player's handbook to read and reference</td>

          <p>The RPG Guild of Newton wishes to provide a fun, safe, and harassment-free experience for everyone.
             Everyone is welcome regardless of gender, identity, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size,
             race, or religion.  We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, in or out of the game. Participants violating
             these rules may need to leave.</p>
          <p>The Dungeon Masters, or DM for short, are the ones in charge of the game at their table.  They are there to
             facilitate gameplay and make the final decision on rules.  It is up to the DM as to what rules they play with.
             Please, respect what the DM says and avoid game-stopping arguments.  DM’s need to keep the gameplay fun and
             engaging for all players.</p>       
          <p>The financial requirements to play are up to you the player.  D&mp;D can be a very cheap game to play.
             You may use an existing mobile device like a smartphone/tablet or use paper and pencil.  We do not want
             financial hardships preventing you from playing.  If you cannot afford something, please, speak with one
             of the organizers.  The organizers try to keep the costs as low as possible.</p>
          <p>Play safe and clean.  No weapons, real or props, are allowed on the premises. The only weapons allowed are
            in-game, imaginary weapons, or as part of a miniature of the character.  This group is open to all ages. 
            Please, use appropriate language and imagery for the youngest member at your table.  Please, include all
            players while playing.  Be respectful to each other and the DMs.  The venue is allowing us to play here for
            very cheap.  Please, make sure you leave it in as good or better condition as you found it.</p>
          <p>You may contact an organizer or a DM to report violations of this code of conduct.</p>
